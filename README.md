# Float Creator

## About The Project

Float Creator is a simple iOS app that allows you to quickly calcuate your new float amount and cashout  for the next day from your till. The app shows an input screen that allows you to enter indivudal precise amounts of all your bill, coin roll, and loose coins giving a breakdown and total for *everything* in your till.

Based on a preset "float amount", the app will calculate how much, and of the best suggested combination of cash, will be deposited as your cashout (profits) and the remaining will be your float adding up to the exact desired float total.

Float Creator makes it easy to quickly make a float everyday. You don't need to do math, multiply, or use a spare piece of paper anymore to accuarelty count you till; you only have to enter the data once and the rest is easily calculated making cashout times at the end of a long shift even faster.
